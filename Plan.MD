This phase ensures the project is easy to set up, contribute to, and maintain, establishing a rock-solid foundation for all future development.

### 1.1 Dependency and Environment Management
- **Task:** Solidify dependency management for reproducible builds.
  - **Subtask:** Audit `pyproject.toml` and `hatch.toml` to ensure all direct and transitive dependencies are pinned to exact versions.
  - **Subtask:** Implement a dependency update policy and schedule for performing security and feature updates.
  - **Output Expectation:** Any developer checking out a specific commit can create an identical environment. Builds are 100% reproducible.

### 1.2 Contribution and Style Guidelines
- **Task:** Create comprehensive contribution guidelines.
  - **Subtask:** Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file detailing the end-to-end development workflow: cloning, environment setup, running tests, coding style, and the pull request process.
  - **Subtask:** Formalize the code style using the existing `ruff` and `mypy` configurations. Ensure the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` enforces all style and linting rules automatically.
  - **Output Expectation:** A new contributor can self-onboard and submit a high-quality pull request that passes all automated checks without needing direct guidance.

### 1.3 Build and Automation System
- **Task:** Enhance the `Makefile` for streamlined development operations.
  - **Subtask:** Add the following targets: `make clean` (removes build artifacts), `make docs` (generates all project documentation), `make package` (builds distributable artifacts), `make scan-vulnerabilities` (runs dependency security scans).
  - **Subtask:** Ensure `make test` runs the complete test suite, including unit, integration, and E2E tests.
  - **Output Expectation:** Common development and CI/CD tasks are automated and accessible via single, memorable commands.

## 2.0 Core Architecture and Application Logic

This phase focuses on refactoring the core application to be more robust, scalable, and maintainable by enforcing clear boundaries and data contracts.

### 2.1 Architectural Review and Refinement
- **Task:** Decouple components and clarify data flows.
  - **Subtask:** Create a detailed `ARCHITECTURE.md` document with C4-style diagrams illustrating component interactions and data flow between the CLI, core logic (`rules`, `chemistry`), agents, and I/O modules.
  - **Subtask:** Refactor modules to use explicit dependency injection instead of direct imports where components represent external services or stateful managers.
  - **Subtask:** Abstract core business logic from framework-specific code (e.g., FastAPI, Typer).
  - **Output Expectation:** The architecture is clearly documented and modular, allowing individual components to be replaced or tested in isolation.

### 2.2 Data Model Validation
- **Task:** Implement strict, validated data models for all internal and external data structures.
  - **Subtask:** Replace all dictionary-based data objects with Pydantic models. This applies to chemical structures, agent requests/responses, and configuration objects.
  - **Subtask:** Ensure all data crossing application boundaries (file I/O, API calls, user input) is parsed and validated by these models.
  - **Output Expectation:** The application is resilient to malformed data. Data integrity is guaranteed at runtime.

## 3.0 Command-Line Interface (CLI) Enhancement

This phase aims to transform the CLI into a professional, user-friendly, and completely reliable tool.

### 3.1 Robustness and User Experience
- **Task:** Harden the CLI against all forms of invalid input and provide superior user feedback.
  - **Subtask:** Implement comprehensive argument validation using Typer's features for types, ranges, and callbacks.
  - **Subtask:** Institute a global exception handling hook that catches all unhandled exceptions and presents clean, actionable error messages to the user instead of stack traces.
  - **Subtask:** Integrate `tqdm` progress bars for all long-running operations (e.g., data processing, report generation).
  - **Subtask:** Implement structured logging with configurable verbosity levels (`--verbose`, `--quiet`) and output formats (`--log-format json`).
  - **Output Expectation:** The CLI feels polished and reliable. It guides the user, provides clear feedback, and fails gracefully with informative messages.

### 3.2 Feature Completeness
- **Task:** Add professional-grade CLI features.
  - **Subtask:** Implement shell completion for all commands and arguments (e.g., for Bash, Zsh, Fish).
  - **Subtask:** Ensure every command, subcommand, and option has comprehensive and well-formatted help text.
  - **Output Expectation:** The CLI is self-documenting and easy to use interactively.

## 4.0 AI Agent Integration

This phase hardens the system's interaction with external AI models, making it resilient, observable, and secure.

### 4.1 Resilience and Error Handling
- **Task:** Implement a robust client for interacting with AI agents.
  - **Subtask:** In `agents/openai_agent.py` and any other agent implementations, add automatic retries with exponential backoff for transient network errors and rate limit responses (e.g., 429, 5xx status codes).
  - **Subtask:** Implement a configurable timeout for all external API calls.
  - **Subtask:** Add a circuit breaker mechanism to prevent repeated calls to a failing service.
  - **Output Expectation:** The application remains stable and responsive even when external AI services are degraded or unavailable.

### 4.2 Observability and Caching
- **Task:** Log and cache all agent interactions.
  - **Subtask:** Implement structured logging for every agent request and response, capturing timing, token usage, and model identifiers.
  - **Subtask:** Implement a persistent caching layer (e.g., using `sqlite-utils` or `diskcache`) for agent responses to reduce latency and cost for repeated queries. The cache should be invalidated based on the request payload.
  - **Output Expectation:** All AI interactions are auditable. System performance and cost are optimized via caching.

### 4.3 Security
- **Task:** Prevent prompt injection and data leakage.
  - **Subtask:** Implement strict input sanitization and output validation for all data passed to and received from AI agents.
  - **Subtask:** Develop and document clear input formatting and context-fencing strategies to mitigate the risk of prompt injection attacks.
  - **Output Expectation:** The agent subsystem is hardened against malicious user inputs.

## 5.0 Testing and Quality Assurance

This phase implements a comprehensive, multi-layered testing strategy to ensure correctness, and reliability.

### 5.1 Test Coverage and Quality
- **Task:** Achieve near-total test coverage with high-quality tests.

  - **Subtask:** Implement property-based tests using `hypothesis` for functions that perform complex data transformations, especially in `chemistry.py`.
  - **Subtask:** Write a comprehensive suite of integration tests that verify the interactions between the CLI, core logic, and agent modules.
  - **Subtask:** Create a suite of end-to-end (E2E) tests for the CLI that execute complete user workflows on a controlled dataset (using `scripts/generate_demo_data.py`).
  - **Output Expectation:** A test suite that provides extremely high confidence in the application's correctness and catches regressions before they reach production.

### 5.2 CI/CD Integration
- **Task:** Automate all quality checks in the CI pipeline.
  - **Subtask:** Configure the `ci.yml` workflow to run the full test suite (unit, integration, E2E) on every pull request and merge to the main branch.
  - **Subtask:** Gate pull request merges on the successful completion of all tests, linting (`ruff`), and static type checks (`mypy`).
  - **Output Expectation:** No code can be merged unless it meets all defined quality standards.

## 6.0 Security Hardening

This phase focuses on identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities across the application.

### 6.1 Vulnerability Management
- **Task:** Implement continuous dependency and code scanning.
  - **Subtask:** Integrate `pip-audit` or a similar tool into the CI pipeline to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
